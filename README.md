# NeqSim Matlab
NeqSim Matlab is part of the [NeqSim project](https://equinor.github.io/neqsimhome/). NeqSim Matlab is a Matlab interface to the [NeqSim Java library](https://github.com/equinor/neqsim) for estimation of fluid behavior and process design for oil and gas production.

## Releases
See [release folder](https://github.com/equinor/neqsimmatlab/releases)

## Getting Started
See the [NeqSim Matlab Wiki](https://github.com/equinor/neqsimmatlab/wiki) for how to use NeqSim Matlab.


### Initial setup
The NeqSim Matlab package is downloaded by cloning the library to your local computer (alternatively fork it to your private reprository). The following commands are dependent on a local installation of [GIT](https://git-scm.com/). 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/equinor/neqsimmatlab.git
